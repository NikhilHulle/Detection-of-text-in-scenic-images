According to Wikipedia, \Optical Character Recognition or Optical Character
Reader(OCR) is the conversion of images of typed, handwritten, or
printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document,
a photo of a document, a scene-photo, or from subtitle text superimposed on
an image." A typical OCR software operates as a 3 step process. These three
steps are preprocessing, text recognition, and post-processing. The overall
performance of the OCR engine depends on the effeciency and effectiveness
of these three steps. This proposed model is able to recognize text from images
of objects with irregular surfaces (the scope of inputs for this project is
limited to medicine strips) and then match the input to a more general case
and then re-route to an external website to display the search results which
may give more information or details for the provided input. We extend
the existing open source OCR software Tesseract's functionality to be able
to identify and provide a more accurate output specifically for images with
uneven characteristics.
